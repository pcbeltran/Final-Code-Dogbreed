# Code_C_final

## Motivation

_My motivation for this project was to make a fun app that would complement another project we worked on during the semester that works as a dating app to find and adopt pets._

### Current Status

The current status of my app is basically done, you can edit, delete and add new dog breeds, I would like to eventually add the option for users to be able to add more than just dogs breeds and add other animals.

#### Images
